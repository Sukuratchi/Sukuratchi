# Hiya

## Welcome to my github! <br> 
### About me <br>
I'm _Sukuratchi, usually shortened to "suku" or "scratch". <br>
I like lots of things, curious about even more but unfortunately forever going to be bad at programming (probably :P). <br>
Most comfortable with python for now, learning C#. <br>
I go by "they/them" pronouns 
<br>

### What is this place? <br>
Here you'll find random stuff that I work on. <br>
Right now I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/Sukuratchi/elaina"> a discord bot that I've named Elaina! </a>
<br>

### Where can I contact you? <br>
You can send me an email at <a href="mailto:contact@sukuratchi.moe">contact@sukuratchi.moe</a>
